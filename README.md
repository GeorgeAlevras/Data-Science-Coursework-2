# Data Science Coursework 2 #

This was my second of two courseworks representing 60% of the course 'Methods for Data Science' - obtaining a grade of 96.8%. Developed and utilised ML models programmed in Python with NumPy, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn to classify MNIST fashion data and explore group dynamics of social networks in an unsupervised way. Developed custom Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), applied dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF), designed clustering algorithms including graph-based analysis spectral clustering and centralities (PageRank, degree, and eigenvector centrality), and modularity maximisation with the Louvain algorithm.

- A Jupyter Lab file containing the coursework code and the write-up markdown `alevras_coursework_2.ipynb`
- A directory with the raw data `./data/`
- A directory with images for the coursework `./images/`
- A directory with Numpy objejcts storing data variables `./numpy_objects`
